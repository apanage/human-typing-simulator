Hereâ€™s a complete README.md for your GitHub repository:
Human Typing Simulator

A Python script that simulates human-like typing by typing text character by character with realistic delays, random typos, and automatic corrections. Perfect for creating natural typing simulations or automating text input with a human touch.
Features

    Simulates human typing by adding delays between each character.
    Random typos are introduced and corrected automatically.
    Reads text from an external file (output.txt) for flexible content.
    Adjustable parameters for typing speed, random delay variations, and typo frequency.

How It Works

    The script reads text from a file named output.txt.
    It simulates typing each character one by one with a base delay.
    Occasionally, it introduces a random typo (e.g., special characters) and deletes it using a backspace.
    The final output matches the content of output.txt.

Installation

    Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/human-typing-simulator.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd human-typing-simulator

Install the required dependencies using pip:

    pip install keyboard

Usage

    Create or edit a file named output.txt in the same directory as the script. Add the text you want to simulate typing.

    Example output.txt content:

Hello there! This is a demonstration of human-like typing simulation.

Run the script:

    python human_typing_simulator.py

    Watch as the text from output.txt is typed out in a human-like manner.

Customization

You can customize the typing behavior by modifying the parameters in the human_like_typing function:

    base_delay: Base delay between typing each character (default is 0.1 seconds).
    random_factor: Adds random variability to the delay for a more natural feel (default is 0.05 seconds).
    typo_chance: Probability of introducing a random typo (default is 0.1 or 10%).

Example:

human_like_typing(content, base_delay=0.2, random_factor=0.1, typo_chance=0.2)

Example Output

If output.txt contains:

Hello, world!

The script might output this (with simulated delays and corrections):

H
e
l
l
o
,
[typo: #] Backspace
[correction:  ]
w
o
r
l
d
!

Requirements

    Python 3.7 or later
    keyboard module (pip install keyboard)
